## How to install
Since the package is not yet registered, it can't be downloaded the same way as registered packages. 
Still, the process is fairly similiar. Open a Julia REPL by tpying:

```
julia
```

Then, in this REPL, open Julias package manager by typing:

```

```

And finally install the package via its GitHub link (same link you would use for cloning):

```
add https://github.com/Matt266/ArraySignalProcessing.jl.git
```
